# Project Rules and Conventions

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: 16.0.10 (latest version)
- **Tailwind CSS**: 4.1.18 (v4 - latest major version)
- **React**: 19.2.3
- **TypeScript**: 5.9.3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Tailwind CSS v4 Specifics

- Uses `@import 'tailwindcss'` instead of traditional config file
- Uses `@theme` directive for configuration
- Uses `@custom-variant` for custom variants (syntax: `&:is(.dark *)` not `&: is(.dark *)`)
- Modern CSS-first approach

## Code Quality Rules

1. **Always provide a plan** for implementation first before making any changes
2. **Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – each file should handle only one concern
3. **Create New Files When Needed** – don't hesitate to create new files for better organization

## Project Structure

- Components are organized in `components/` directory
- UI components in `components/ui/`
- Dashboard-specific components in `components/dashboard/`
- Database schemas in `lib/db/schema/`
- Server actions in `lib/actions/`
- Utilities in `lib/utils.ts`
- Hooks in `hooks/`

## TypeScript

- Use strict mode
- Path aliases: `@/*` maps to project root
- Use TypeScript for all new files

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 utilities
- Follow existing component patterns
- Use shadcn/ui components from `components/ui/`

## Database

- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations

## General Guidelines

- Prefer functional components
- Use React Server Components by default
- Use Client Components only when necessary (add 'use client' directive)
- Follow Next.js 16 App Router conventions
- Use async/await for server-side operations
- for types have one single source of truth by using z.infer from schema files. if we need to create relations for DB also create a type using drizzle zod for the relation.
- run pnpm run check:types and pnpm run check:eslint after new changes to confirm everything works
- CRUD operations should be put in an actions folder and be [feature].ts
